Group member's names and x500s
    --> Curtis Kokuloku - kokul003
    --> Atakilt Massengill - masse171

Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner)
    --> MyMaze.java class was implemented by both Curtis and Atakilt using algorithms from lecture, labs, and examples
        Some algorithms were implemented using self-knowledge and/or other resources
    --> Helper functions (getRandomNeighbor(), getRandomRow () & checkInBounds()), switch statement in makeMaze() and
        in main() were implemented by Curtis

How to compile and run your program
    --> DO NOT CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON WHEN USING YOUR FAVORITE EDITOR
    --> Download 'kokul003_masse171_Project4.zip' file and decompress it
    --> Use the TERMINAL
    --> Go to directory with all the files
    --> WARNING: Make sure you are in the right directory/module that contain all the classes
    --> To Run MyMaze.java
        --> Type javac MyMaze.java to compile and then java MyMaze to run

Any assumptions
    --> Assume that all the algorithms in every class are implemented using examples from lectures,
        own knowledge and/or other resources

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
    --> getRandomNeighbor() - helper method to choose a random neighbor to the corresponding cell
    --> checkInBounds() - helper method to check if the rows and columns from user are in bounds
    --> getRandomRow() - helper method to choose a random start and end row, based on the row

Any known bugs or defects in the program
    --> I suggest "playing"/running this more than one time till satifaction.
    --> You can assume that there is no bugs or failures in the program.
